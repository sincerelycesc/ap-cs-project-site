          I recreated the popular snake game, you’re a snake who’s trying to
          grow as long as possible by collecting food, while also not trying to
          hit yourself or the edges. I used a website called scratch. The goal
          was to make it my own style, so I created my own snake and colors
          which are different from others. I also made it so the amount of food
          that’s in the game at a time is randomized. What was challenging was
          creating the different code to not mess up movement of the snake,
          because simple movement code wasn’t enough. I learned how to implement
          randomization into code, being able to give random locations for the
          food, but with set intervals so it could only be in so many spots.

          Me and two of my friends created our own drawing app, in which you can
          use different colors and shapes to draw whatever you want. We used a
          website called Snap. The goal was to implement the most basic features
          a drawing app must have to function properly. This includes an erase
          tool, size tool, and clear all tools. It was challenging to add bonus
          items, such as the asterisk tool, which specifically was my own little
          project for this app. I learned a lot more difficult coding, and the
          use of creating your own code blocks which you can add to.

          For my CTE Business class, I used google sheets in order to create my
          own checkbook. This was to organize all of my deposits and withdrawals
          on different bank accounts, given the date, item number, description,
          amount of withdrawal/deposit, and balance. This was my first time ever
          using google sheets to make something myself, so that was challenging.
          I was able to learn different equations to make the process of
          inputting transactions easier.
